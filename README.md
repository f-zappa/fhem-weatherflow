# fhem-weatherflow
  This FHEM module listens to broadcast messages sent out by the WeatherFlow hub. It has been
  designed and tested for the <a href="https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/">
  Tempest Weather System</a>, but should also be capable to work with the older
  WeatherFlow Smart Weather Station.
